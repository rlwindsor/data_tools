This document is to built to produce weekly reports on **node health**, **tag localizations**, and the script itself. Script will be updated as often as upstream (CTT data_tools) is updated and new features are added. We are using R linked with GitHub to download the source code, keep track of updates and changes made on both ends, and share the code with whoever is interested. 

Download all data files (GPS, node health, radiotags) from https://account.celltracktech.com/

Always start the session with `git pull upstream master` in Tools > Shell to pull any chances made upstream (CTT data_tools)
